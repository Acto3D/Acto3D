Privacy Policy

Naoki Takeshita built the Acto3D app as an Open Source app. This SERVICE is provided by Naoki Takeshita at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page informs visitors about my stance regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information for anyone who decides to use my Service.

By using my Service, you acknowledge and agree to the policies outlined herein. Importantly, I do not collect, use, or share any personal information.

The terms in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at Acto3D unless otherwise defined here.

Information Collection

I do not collect or request any personally identifiable information for the use of this Service. Moreover, no such information will be retained or stored on your device or any other medium.

Log Data

For debugging purposes, Acto3D does create log data in case of an error. This log data may contain filenames or directory names you used within Acto3D. However, please rest assured that Acto3D does not have the capability to transmit any log files. Unless you intentionally send the log files, no information will be collected from them.

Cookies

My Service does not use "cookies" explicitly. If any third-party code or libraries are integrated into the app, I ensure they also do not use cookies or any other means to collect information.

Service Providers

I do not employ any third-party companies or individuals for the provision of the Service.

Security

Although I do not collect any personal information, I am committed to ensuring the security and safety of the app and its users.

Links to Other Sites

The Service may contain links to other sites. If you access a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content or privacy policies of any third-party sites or services.

Childrenâ€™s Privacy

This Service does not collect personal information from anyone, including children. Parents and guardians can feel secure knowing that their child's privacy remains protected.
